# Dumpify
Improve productivity and debuggability by a `.Dump()` extension methods to **Console Applications**, similar to LinqPad's.

One of my favorites LinqPad feature is its `.Dump()` extension methods and how customizable they are, and it was always hard to return to Visual Studio and find out this features doesn't exist there.

# Features

# How to use
Either use `dotnet add package Dumpify` or `Install-Package Dumpify`

# Disclaimer
This project is inspired by LinqPad's Dump features, authored by Joseph Albahari.
